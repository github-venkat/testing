above line may not work because you meed to give access to remote path you're working on 
1) Find what remote path you're on 
	you can get this by running git remote -v
	else you can also get this by copying github_cli URL under "code"

2) Next you can add your remote path with command

git remote add orgin <copied URL>

3) Now push main 

git push orgin main
